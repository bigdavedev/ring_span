How to contribute
=================

First of all, thanks for considering contributing. Reading this document is a
great first step on that path.

The work in this repository is done as part of my role in the Swedish National
Body for ISO C++ (formally SIS TK611/AG09). If you haven't already, please join
out Slack community [SwedenCpp][slack] and specifically, the #sc22_wg21
channel.

Testing
-------

There exist unit tests in the tests/ folder. Every PR should contain sufficient
testing for any work done in the code.

Submitting changes
------------------

Please submit PRs to this repository via GitHub with a clear list of changes
that are made.

Ensure that your commit message is focussed and follows the conventions laid
out in the, now famous, [article by Chris Beams][beams].
